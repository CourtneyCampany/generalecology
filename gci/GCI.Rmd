## My Role: Survey scientists to extract current ecological issues
<hr>
<br/>

<div class="centered"><strong>I was wondering if you would propose an ecological problem related to your interests, which students could try to solve. The problem could be regionally related to the USA or possibly at a larger scale.</strong></div>

<br/>

<div class="centered"><strong>However, any topic you would like to propose would be totally great. Whatever you truly believe is a pressing issue.</strong></div>

<br/>

<div class="centered"><strong>The idea is that students have the semester to work towards potential solutions and develop an **Ecological Action Plan**. </strong></div>

<br/>

<div class="centered"><strong>Although they may not be able to solve the problem this concept brings in work-related deadlines, active self-learning, inclusive and diversity driven group work and most importantly activism. </strong></div>

## Semester Theme: Invasives
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

**Invasive species cause over $135 billion dollars in damages to North American ecosystems and can alter the services that natural ecosystems provide to society. Some of these introductions were deliberate while others were inadvertent. In both cases, the functional traits that allow a species to be invasive are poorly known, and worse, many introductions, once established, are difficult if not impossible to eradicate. Therefore, we do not yet know how to predict which species could become problems in the future, which makes it difficult to predict future impacts.**

>- <span style="color:green">How should the U.S. deal with the subject of invasive species, especially from the standpoint of maintaining maximum services from our natural ecosystems?</strong></span>
