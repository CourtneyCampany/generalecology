## Macquarie Island ecosystem
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Macquarie island is part of the state of Tasmania**
    + UNESCO world heritage site
    + halfway between New Zealand and Australia

<br/>

* **Important ecosystems to conserve**
    + breeding grounds for elephant seals
    + bredding grounds for royal penguins
    
 <br/>
 
* **Currently home to dozen(ish) scientists & rangers**
    + did not use to be that way

</div>

## The sealing era: Captain Frederick Hasselborough
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Seals and penguins had no natural predators on the island until 1810**
    + populations ~200,000 - 400,000

<br/>

* **What happened: Humans happened!!**

<br/>

* **Europeans arrived on the Perseverance**
    + hunted seals to near local extinction

<br/>

* **Then exploited penguins for oil**
    + processed 2,000 penguins a day for .5 liters of oil each

</div>

## Unintended consequences
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Any place on earth, at the time, visited by ships likely introduced rats**

<br/>

* **Macquarie island had no rodent before seal hunting**

<br/>

* **Soon, rats and mice populations exploded on Macquarie island**

</div>

## Any good seafarer knows how to control rats...
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

* **Most ships had a cat or two just for this purpose**

<br/>

* **Within 10 years, large feral cats on the island**
    + Unfortunately, cats eat more than rats....
    
<br/>

* **The Otago Whaling Company also released rabbits in 1870**
    + food source for workers
    + rabbits share niche with sea birds...
 
 </div>

## 1970: Scientists decided to fix things (sigh)
<hr>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Ecosystem was wrecked**
    + Seals & penguins were recovering
    + Rbbits were everywhere

<br/>

* **Scientists introduced Myxoma (via fleas) a fatal rabbit virus**
    + reduced rabbits fro 130,000 - 10,000
    + but........

<br/>

* **With the rabbits gone the feral cats.....**

<br/>

* **Hunting dogs were used to kill the cats**
    + the rabbits were still around.....

</div>

## Today: Unravel the species interactions of Macquarie island
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

* **Use the integrated diagrams to unpack species interactions on the island**
    + petrel, prion, shearwaters and wekas are all birds
    + examine the interactions between species on Fig 2

<br/>

* **Work together to understand the new plan hathed in 2010:**
    + eliminate all invasive species at one time
