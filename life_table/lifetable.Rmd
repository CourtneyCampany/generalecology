## Static vs Cohort life tables
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Static life table: Based on age distribution at one point in time**
    + Assumes age distribution is stable

<br/>
<br/>

* **Cohort life table:Follows a cohort across time**
    + assumes age distribution is stable
    + difficult long-lived and/or highly mobile animals

</div>

## Understanding life tables (page #1 handout)
<hr>

* **Age Class (usually years)**

<br/>

* **Number alive**

<br/>

* **Survivorship (Lx): mortality based on original cohort**

<br/>

* **Fecundity (Mx): average offspring born to individuals of each age**

<br/>

* **Survivorship x Fecundity (R): # of female young produced per indivdual**
    + basic reproductive rate (age class)
    
## Survivorship curves: log(Lx) versus cohort age

## Verreaux’s Sifakas Lemurs
<hr>
<br/>

* **Diurnal primates found in the dry forests of southern Madagascar**

<br/>

* **Limited range and habitat loss has resulted in Endangered status**

<br/>

* **Females are socially dominant and territorial**

<br/>

* **Females have just one infant at a time**
    + Relative to other mammals of their size, female sifakas reach reproductive maturity later and live longer

## Richard et al 2002
<hr>
<br/>

* **Observational study of a population of sifakas in the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwest Madagascar**

<br/>

* **1984 – 1999: Captured 426 animals**
    + Each animal tagged and aged based on toothwear
    + Recorded sex, survival and fertility through time
    + No females under 3 years old gave birth.

<br/>

* **Today we will complete a static life stable to determine whether this threatened population is at risk of extinction**


## Estimating Fecundity (mx)
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Mx = per capita birth rate (number of offspring born per individual in age class)**

<br/>

* **Richard et al. (2002) recorded the proportion of female sifakas of every age (3 – 26) that gave birth in each year from 1984 – 1999**

<br/>

* **From these data, the median birthrates for 3 year age classes are reported in Table 1 of the handout**

## Estimating Fecundity (Mx)
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Life tables often include only data for females, as females limit reproduction, and hence population growth**

<br/>

* **Since Nx values are for females, we need an Mx estimate for number of females/female**

<br/>

* **?Does Mx(3-5) = 0.07?**

## Age-dependent life table
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Calculate survivorship and maternal reproduction rate as a function of age**

<br/>

* **In nature, survivorship and reproduction rate depend on numerous factors**
    + temperature, population density, etc.
    + the effect of these factors are encompassed into age class dynamics

<br/>

* **Population growth Paratmeter (Ro): Sum of Survivorship x Fecundity**
    + net reproductive rate
    + if Ro > 1, population is growing
    + Ro = 2.5 = a lemur produces 2.5 baby lemurs on average in a lifetime
