## Static vs Cohort life tables
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Static life table: Based on age distribution at one point in time**

<br/>

* **Cohort life table: Follows individuals across time**
    + difficult for long-lived and/or mobile animals

<br/>

* **Both must assume age distribution is stable**

</div>

## Understanding life tables (page #1 handout)
<hr>

* **Age Class (usually years)**

<br/>

* **Number alive (n~x~)**

<br/>

* **Survivorship (l~x~): mortality based on original cohort**

<br/>

* **Birthrate per capita (m~x~): average offspring born to individuals of each age**

<br/>

* **Fecundity (F~x~): total number of females produced by females**

<br/>

* **Net reproductive rate(R): Survivorship x Birthrate (age class)**
    + some will die without making offspring
    
## Survivorship curves: log(l~x~) versus cohort age

## Verreaux’s Sifakas Lemurs
<hr>
<br/>

* **Diurnal primates found in the dry forests of southern Madagascar**

<br/>

* **Limited range and habitat loss has resulted in Endangered status**

<br/>

* **Females are socially dominant and territorial**

<br/>

* **Females have just one infant at a time**
    + Relative similar sized mammals, female sifakas reach reproductive maturity later and live longer
    + R vs K selected species?

## Richard et al 2002
<hr>
<br/>

* **Observational study of a population of sifakas in the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwest Madagascar**

<br/>

* **1984 – 1999: Captured 426 animals**
    + Each animal tagged and aged based on tooth wear
    + Recorded gender, survival and fertility through time
    + No females under 3 years old gave birth.

<br/>

* **Today we will complete a static life stable (1999) to determine whether this threatened population is at risk of extinction**


## Q1. Estimating Fecundity (m~x~)
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

* **m~x~ = per capita birth rate (number of offspring born per individual in age class)**

<br/>

* **Richard et al. (2002) recorded the proportion of female sifakas of every age (3 – 26) that gave birth in each year from 1984 – 1999**

<br/>

* **From these data, the median birthrates for 3 year age classes are reported in Table 1 of the handout**

## Q1. Estimating Fecundity (m~x~)
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Life tables often include only data for females, as females limit reproduction**
    + males do not grow a population

<br/>

* **Since N~x~ values are for females, we need an m~x~ estimate for number of females/female**

<br/>

* **Does m~x~(3-5) = 0.07?**

## Estimating Fecundity (m~x~)

<br/>
<br/>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:600px; WIDTH:450px; HEIGHT:450px" SRC="images/datatable.png">

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Sex ratio matters since our table is constructed for females**
    + assume 1:1 Male:Female
 
 <br/>
 
* **Lemurs exhibit a male-biased sex ratio at birth**
    + 46.5 % chance of being a female

</div>

## Age-dependent life table
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Calculate survivorship and maternal reproduction rate as a function of age**

<br/>

* **In nature, survivorship and reproduction rate depend on numerous factors**
    + temperature, population density, etc.
    + the effect of these factors are encompassed into age class dynamics

<br/>

* **Population growth parameter (R~o~): Sum of Survivorship x Fecundity**
    + net reproductive rate
    + if R~o~ > 1, population is growing
    + R~o~ = 2.5 = a female produces 2.5 baby lemurs on average in a lifetime
