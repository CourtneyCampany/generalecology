## Animal foragers
<hr>
<br/>

**Which forager type would typically get the best balance of nutrients from their food?**

## Carnivore foraging
<hr>

* **Carnivore prey items contain essentially the same mix of nutrients**
<br/>

* **Foraging success is often assumed (theory) to be limited by prey availability (quantity)**
    + Rather than nutritional balance (quality).

## Carnivore Foraging: Quanitity vs Quality
<hr>

* **Food quantity driving consumption rates, and thus predator-prey populations, is often challenged**
    + Lotka Voltera vs Optimal Foraging

## Case study #1: Wolf spiders, prey quality and consumption
<hr>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
* **Wolf spiders feed near standing water in California (Greenstone 1979)**
    + 80% of the diet is *shore flies*, *water boatmen* and *mosquitoes*
 
 <br />
 
* **Prey species were marked as either present or absent in each spider gut**
    + spiders classified into groups (**answer Q1**)

</div>

<br />

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Spider stomach contents (total N = 1226) from 13 different pools of water**

<br />
<br />

* **Spiders from 7 out of 13 pools were more likely than by chance to have consumed all 3 prey**
    + polyphagy (eat a variety of food)
    + **answer Q2**
    
<br />

* **Side note: Can you imagine making graphs without modern computers!!!**

## Leveling up with Mayntz et al. 2005
<hr>
<br />

* **Hypothesis: IF wolf spiders optimize nutrient intake, THEN they should choose a prey type that remedies a prior nutritional deficiency**
    + experiment manipulating findings from Greenwood (1979)

<br />

* **Nutritional state of the Wolf spiders manipulated by feeding them a pre-treatment diet**
    + fruit flies with high or low ratio of protein to lipid for 1-2 days. 


<br />

* **Then tested feeding responses to the pre-treatment food and/or a complementary alternative**
    + offered only 1 choice (same or different prey)
    + recorded how much of each was eaten
    + **answer Q3**

## Today: Quantitative reasoning practice
<hr>
<br />
<br />

* **In your groups, work through interpretation of the results from these papers**

<br />

* **Use your knowledge of species interactions and evolution to theorize about more complex predator-prey relationships**

<br />

* **These are great practice exam questions!!!**
